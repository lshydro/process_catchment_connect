# process_catchment_connect
Code and data used analyse the connection between flood processes and catchment characteristics

Calculation_visualisation_process_catchment.r includes all calculations and visualisations to interpret the results. 

function_file_global_flood_classification.R contains the code for the global flood classification as described by Stein et al. (2020)

Data requirements to execute the code: 
- CAMELS dataset by Addor et al. (2017) available at https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels
- aws0200NATSGO.csv Available Water Storage data calculated for the CAMELS catchments with data from the NATSGO soil data base. Available as supplemental data for the article submitted to Water Resources Research.
